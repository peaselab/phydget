# PhyDGET: Phylogenetic Differential Gene Expression Tool #

![alt text](https://github.com/peaselab/phydget/blob/main/doc/logo.png)

PhyDGET is a method for analyzing transcriptome-wide expression data in a phylogenetic context to highlight genes whose expression is changing on particular branches of a phylogeny.  PhyDGET is a Pythone3-based parallelized program that connects differential gene expression data transformation to Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (BayesTraits).  PhyDGET also includes post-analysis tools for interpreting the results.
